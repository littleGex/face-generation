# face-generation
One solution to udacity deep-learning nano degree face generation project.

### Info
This project uses generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces. The dataset 
[CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) 
is used to train the model. 

The model generates new images similar to trained celebrity faces using 3 layers, LR=0.0002 and beta values = 0.5 & 0.999.
